Data Analytics Project

OVERVIEW :-

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights. It covers data loading and analysis in Python, data cleaning, SQL querying across multiple databases, and visualization through Power BI. The final outputs include an analytical report and a presentation created using Gamma.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills commonly used in real-world business and analytics roles.

Dataset :-

* The dataset was loaded using Python.

* It contains structured data suitable for exploratory data analysis and SQL-based querying.

* Data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates were addressed during the cleaning phase.

* (Dataset details can be added here if public, or kept generic if confidential.)

Tools & Technologies :-

. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn)

. SQL

. PostgreSQL

. MySQL

. SQL Server

. Power BI (Dashboard creation)

. Gamma (Presentation design)

. Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (Development environment)

Project Steps :-

Data Loading:

* Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Analyzed data structure, distributions, trends, and relationships.

* Identified outliers, missing values, and potential data quality issues.

Data Cleaning:

* Handled missing and inconsistent values.

* Removed duplicates and standardized data formats.

* Prepared clean datasets for analysis and visualization.

SQL Analysis:

* Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.

* Wrote SQL queries to extract insights, perform aggregations, and answer business questions.

Visualization & Dashboard:

* Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to present key metrics and insights.

Reporting & Presentation:

* Created a detailed analytical report summarizing findings.

* Designed a professional presentation using Gamma for stakeholder communication.

Dashboard :-

* The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)

* Trends and comparisons

* Filterable views for deeper analysis

* The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and decision-focused.

Results & Insights :-

* Identified key patterns and trends within the data.

* Translated raw data into actionable insights.

* Delivered clear visual and written outputs suitable for business stakeholders.

How to Run the Project :-

* Clone this repository.

Install required Python libraries:

* pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

* Open the Jupyter Notebook to run the Python analysis.

* Load the cleaned dataset into your preferred SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server).

* Execute the provided SQL queries.

* Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.

* Review the report and presentation for summarized insights.
